# Ad Accelerator

## What is it?

An extension to automatically mute and fastforward or skip through video advertisements, on video sharing sites like Youtube.

## Background
Since Youtube has started taking an aggressive stance with Adblockers and Ublock Origin, I thought this would be a fun project to explore alternate ways to get around advertisements & get more aquinted with developing browser plugins.
